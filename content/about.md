I'm Zac, a software developer and student, and this is
my blog where I write about technology, life, and whatever I find
interesting.

I study Computer Science at George Mason University in Fairfax,
VA. I'm passionate about building great software and always learning new things.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to hit me up on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/_zacwood) or
[email](mailto:zac.wood@hey.com). Interested in some of my open
source projects? Check out my [repos](https://github.com/zacwood9).

## Things I've done

### Work

Starting August 2021, I will be a Software Engineering Associate at [Capital One](https://capitalone.com) in McLean, VA.

Internships:

- Summer 2020 - Software Engineering Intern @ [Capital One](https://capitalone.com)

- Summer 2019 - Software Engineering Intern @ [FireEye](https://www.fireeye.com/)

  - Node.js

### Attics

In October 2018 I released my first iOS app
[Attics](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/attics/id1434981632) to the App
Store. It lets you stream thousands of live Grateful Dead concerts
right from your phone. If you're a Deadhead, you'll love it. I built
it for myself and never expected it to get any users, but with
thousands of downloads, 200+ daily active users, and a (nearly) solid
five star rating, I think I can say it's been a success!

### SRCT

Since the Spring 2018 semester I've been an active member of [Mason
SRCT](https://srct.gmu.edu) and was elected President to
serve for the 2019-2020 academic year, and again for 2020-2021. SRCT stands for Student-Run
Computing and Tech, and we build open source projects to solve
problems that Mason students face.

I'm the project manager of the [Schedules](https://schedules.gmu.edu)
project. It's a website built with Ruby on Rails that lets
students browse the Mason course catalog more fluidly and with more
options than they've ever had with the university's offerings. You can
also export your course schedule to your calendar manager of choice.

Through SRCT, I also love to share the knowledge I've gained through working on these projects.
Students show up to their first SRCT meetings often with
one or two CS classes under their belt, and through one on one
mentoring and the tech talks we give each semester, we teach them
the basics of software development that they can use to build
projects with us and go out into the workforce with essential skills.

I'm Zac, a software engineer, and this is

interesting.

source projects? Check out my [repos](https://github.com/zacwood9).

## Things I've done

I'm currently working at Captial One developing software with marketing tech to incentivize customer behavior.
I also do part-time independent consulting work for companies using Haskell and IHP.

### IHP

At the beginning of 2021 I started contributing to the Haskell web framework [IHP](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com).
I've worked mainly on contributing features upstream that I built for my own app written in IHP. Currently working
on improving the already great developer experience by expanding the IHP web IDE!

I'm a Platnium Partner in the [digitally induced Partner Program]( https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/Partners) under the name [Zallocate Software](https://zallocate.com).
If you're looking to build your business with IHP and are looking for help, please reach out. Depending on availability, I'd be happy to
help develop the project or connect you with other talented IHP developers. I am also available for general Haskell consulting.

### Attics

In October 2018 I released my first iOS app
[Attics](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/attics/id1434981632) to the App
Store. It lets you stream thousands of live Grateful Dead concerts
right from your phone. If you're a Deadhead, you'll love it. I built
it for myself and never expected it to get any users, but with
thousands of downloads, hundreds daily active users, and a (nearly) solid
five star rating, I think I can say it's been a success!

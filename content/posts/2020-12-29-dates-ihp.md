In the [IHP](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/) web framework, columns with the Postgres "Date" type
are translated into Haskell as the [Day](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/time-1.11.1.1/docs/Data-Time-Calendar.html#t:Day) type.
Looking at the docs for `Day`, it isn't exactly clear how to create a `Day` value from a time string. Here's how to do this for a simple case:

```haskell
parseDay :: String -> Day
parseDay = parseTimeOrError True defaultTimeLocale "%Y-%m-%d"
```

which will produce a `Day` value given a string of the form `2020-12-29`. **NOTE:** if the string is not valid, an error will be thrown.
For better error handling, use `parseTimeM`, which is executed in the context of any `MonadFail`, such as the `Maybe` monad:

```haskell
parseDay' :: String -> Maybe Day
parseDay' = parseTimeM True defaultTimeLocale "%Y-%m-%d"
```

For info on all the different format options
for the format string, see [here](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/time-1.11.1.1/docs/Data-Time-Format.html#formatTime).

## Example

In my application, dates from the feed I was parsing had the form `2020-12-28T16:32:12+00:00`.
I did not need the time info, so I could call `parseDay` as such:

```haskell
parseDay $ takeWhile ('T' /=) (cs date)
```

which uses the `cs` function from `Data.String.Conversions`, included with IHP, to convert seamlessly between string types.
With the `Day` object, we can then create an IHP record. Here's an example from my data loading script:

```haskell
itemNodeToEpisode :: ItemNode -> Episode
itemNodeToEpisode ItemNode {..} =
  newRecord @Episode
    |> set #title title
    |> set #description description
    |> set #link link
    |> set #audioLink audioLink
    |> set #date (parseDay $ takeWhile ('T' /=) (cs date))
```
